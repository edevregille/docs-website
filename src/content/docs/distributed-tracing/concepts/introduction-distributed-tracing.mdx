I often get approached by many people asking if coding is necessary for data science. Many of them say they tried learning to code but they think it is not their cup of tea. Some of them reached a point that they now believe they could never learn to code. I had this same thought when I started learning data science. It is a problem of having a fixed mindset, it makes us think that we can’t do certain things. Once you change that to a growth mindset then you realize the potential of perseverance. There is no limit to what we can learn and do. Many people trying to learn coding go through a journey like the one below.


If someone says that you can become a data scientist without learning to code. Do not trust them! 
Definitely not yet. 
Learning to code is absolutely necessary to become a data scientist. 
Anyone can learn to code, the only important factor is, you need to learn it the right way. 
In this article, I will show a roadmap to overcome the initial barriers and be able to learn to code for data science.

## Setting a goal
The biggest mistake many people do is trying to learn a programming language without having a goal. It is important to know the goal you need to achieve. Before starting to learn you need to understand what you want to do with programming. You need answers to questions like, How and Where do you want to use it? What results do you want to produce? What problems do you want to solve?
If I take Python as an example. It can be used for building websites, software applications, data analysis, machine learning, building data pipelines, visualization, and much more. There is no way you can master Python programming without knowing what you want to do with it.

As an aspiring data scientist, your goal with learning to code will be:

* Read and write data from different sources:
* Work on different data types
* Perform data analysis
* Build and evaluate models
* While getting started with data science do not worry about writing an efficient code. Just focus on getting things done. You will get to learn about the standards and efficient scripting as you start putting it to use.

Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. With distributed tracing data, you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues and fix them.

Distributed tracing systems collect data as the requests go from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request.

  ![Diagram showing how spans are generated in a distributed trace](./images/intro-DT.png "Diagram showing how spans are generated in a distributed trace")

    Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace.
  </figcaption>

## Why it matters

A request might pass through various microservices to reach completion. The microservices or functions could be located in multiple containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, on-premises, or any combination of these.

For example, let's say that you're in a situation where a slow-running request affects the experience of a set of customers:

* The request is distributed across multiple microservices and serverless functions. 
* Several different teams own and monitor the various services that are involved in the request.
* None of the teams have reported any performance issues with their microservices. 

Without a way to view the performance of the entire request across the different services, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint where and why the high latency is occurring and which team should address the issue. 

## Instrumentation: The key to distributed tracing

Distributed tracing starts with the instrumentation of your services to enable data collection and correlation across the entire distributed system. Instrumention means either manually adding code to services or installing agents that automatically track trace data. 

Many of our New Relic solutions automatically instrument your services for a large number of programming languages and frameworks. You can also use open source tools and open instrumentation standards to instrument your environment. OpenTelemetry, part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/), is becoming the one standard for open source instrumentation and telemetry collection. 

## What you can see in the New Relic UI

After the data is collected, you can visualize it to see service dependencies, performance, and any anomalous events such as errors or unusual latency. Here are some examples of what you can do with your data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        What you can do
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Detect anomalous spans](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui/#anomalous-spans)
      </td>

      <td>
        Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [See your errors and logs](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui#view-your-logs)
      </td>

      <td>
        Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place.

        You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.
